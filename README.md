a python3.6 implementation of 'sparse symbolic representation'

using methods in utils.py, main.ipynb shows how to

- generate candidate subsequences of a given alphabetic sequence dataset
- evaluate them
- selecting the best candidate as the 'shapelet'
- transforming the sequence dataset according to the selected shapelet
